# RL-AutoGuiding
In this project, We use modified A3C and DQN algorithm to train the agent to automatically find the shortest path to specified target.

In order to have a benchmark of the performance of such algorithms, we simplify the problem to model-based question and apply q learning to calculate the optimal path.
